# hyperskill-timer

JetBrains Academy (Hyperskill) shows an average time for problem completion but you have no idea how much time you've spent unless you start a separate timer somewhere else.

This adds a simple timer next to the average solving time so you have an idea of how much time you've spent.

Timer is not saved for future reference.
